# At times you need one VM to find another.  This is a quick way to do that.
# 10.0.2.2 is the default gateway on guest box so setting a hostname of additional vagrant boxes will 
# cause it to look to the host machine for that box.  I also have these names set in my hosts file on my local box so I can 
# use the same names.
#
# Since it is on another port it will loop back to that 
# other box.  I have a Tomcat box that my Apache box needs to find.

# By default I have enable_other_hosts set to false.  You must set this to true for it to work.
