# For this to work you need to do a "berks vendor" from the C:\vagrantboxes/apache-tomcat/ directory
# example: berks vendor C:\vagrantboxes/apache-tomcat/cookbooks/ 
# this download the cookbooks from the chef server, and supermarket, etc into the directory defined in local_cookbooks_path
# here is the directory structure I used with this.  All files are placed in the apache-tomcat directory
# the cookbook directory will be created by "berks"
